### Hello, I'm Gabriel, 22 yo ðŸ‘‹
- I'm new to programming and I learn by reading Docs, Googling, Practing & Checking how other people code.

- I'm currently improving my React+TypeScript skills, and I plan to start learning SQL & NextJS.

- All content of my repository is made by ***me*** from the scratch. But I may have take some inspiration somewhere.

### Skills I'm improving
- Vanilla JavaScript
- TypeScript
- ReactJS
- MySQL
- Web APIs
- NextJS
- UI Clone //
***I replicate landing pages in order to improve my CSS skills***

### Main Project ***Simp Scan (a library books project)***
- This is a personal project for hobby of mine, that I translate some ***asian books (japanese/korean/chinese)*** from English to Portuguese.

- Build with React and used next to set a dynamic route, to fetch new chapter and update the url, saving hardcoding a new page for each chapter.

- You can see a more detailed explanation about it in [here](https://github.com/dotdott/novel-scan)

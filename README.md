### Hello, I'm Gabriel, 22 yo ðŸ‘‹
- I'm new to programming and I learn by reading Docs, Googling, Practing & Checking how other people code.

- I'm currently improving my React+TypeScript skills, and I plan to start learning SQL & NextJS.

- All content of my repository is made by ***me*** from the scratch. But I may have take some inspiration somewhere.

### Skills I'm improving
- Vanilla JavaScript
- TypeScript
- ReactJS
- Web APIs
- NextJS
- UI Clone //
***I replicate landing pages in order to improve my CSS skills***

### Main Project ***Still developing***
- This is a personal project for hobby of mine, that I translate some ***professional/amateur books*** from English to Portuguese.

- ***Overall*** it is ***"already"*** completed since it works just fine and do what it is supposed to do. But I still have better plans and implementations that i haven't learned yet how to apply it to the project. 

- Briefly stating my futures plans, I plan to implement a back-end server to save all the chapters, and make a better user experience & better readable content, like ***Last update's / New's / What's upcoming / Realese data***  

- You can see a more detailed explanation about it in [here](https://github.com/dotdott/novel-scan)
